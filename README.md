# Handwritten-Text-Analyzer
This is a class project from CMU 16385. It trains a neural network to recognize handwritten text.
This project is designed to train students' understanding in the concept of neural network, so the
forward and backward propogations were written from scratch. The training process is done without
tools like PyTorch.
The /images directory contains some images with handwritten texts. You can add more images of handwritten texts
to this directory to test out the model accuracy.
You can run /python/run_q4.py to get model recognition results for image inputs.
